# ElastAlert 2

From <https://elastalert2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elastalert.html#overview>:

> ElastAlert 2 is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.

ElastAlert queries [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md) and provides an alerting mechanism with multiple output types, such as Slack, Email, JIRA, OpsGenie, and many more.

## Sigma Rules

The Detections module will generate ElastAlert 2 compatible rules automatically for all [Sigma](sigma.md) detections. There is no need to manually modify the generated rules on disk. Further, any modifications will be overwritten during the next [Sigma](sigma.md) rule synchronization.

Adjusting a [Sigma](sigma.md) rule should always be done via the [Detections](detections.md) screen.

See the [notifications](notifications.md) section for information on how to enable outbound notifications via the Detections module.

## Custom Rules

Custom ElastAlert 2 rules, which are not associated to the Detections module, can be added to the Security Onion Manager node inside a custom subdirectory under the `/opt/so/rules/elastalert/rules/` directory. For example, create a subdirectory called `/opt/so/rules/elastalert/rules/custom/` and place custom rules within that directory. 

!!! WARNING
    
    Do not modify or add rules to the `/opt/so/rules/elastalert/rules/` directory itself as those rules are overwritten by the Detections module.

Refer to the ElastAlert 2 documentation, linked above, for detailed information on how to write custom rules. Be aware that writing rules requires an in-depth understanding of Elasticsearch document records, their data structure, and other related concepts.

## Diagnostic Logging

ElastAlert diagnostic logs are in `/opt/so/log/elastalert/` and may also appear in the [Docker](docker.md) logs for the container. To view container logs run the following command on the Manager:

```bash
sudo docker logs so-elastalert
```

ElastAlert 2 stores rule status information, such as number of hits, times each rule last ran, etc. to [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md) indices. This data can be helpful in assisting with troubleshooting custom rules. You can search for this data in [Dashboards](dashboards.md), [Hunt](hunt.md), or [Kibana](kibana.md). [SOC](security-onion-console.md) does not automatically include the `ElastAlert` indices by default. If you would like to include them, you can adjust the appropriate configuration setting. In [SOC](security-onion-console.md), navigate to [Administration](administration.md) --> Configuration. At the top of the page, click the `Options` menu and then enable the `Show advanced settings` option. Then filter for `elastic.index` to locate the setting. On the right side of the screen, add `*:Elastalert*` to the existing `index` setting. The updated setting should resemble the following:


```
*:so-*,*:endgame-*,*:logs-*,*:ElastAlert*
```

### so-elastalert-create

`so-elastalert-create` can be used to help ease the pain of ensuring correct syntax and creating ElastAlert rules from scratch. It will walk you through various questions, and eventually output an ElastAlert rule file that you can deploy in your environment to start alerting quickly and easily.

### so-elastalert-test

`so-elastalert-test` is a wrapper script for ElastAlert's `elastalert-test-rule` tool.  The script allows you to test an ElastAlert rule and get results immediately. Simply run `so-elastalert-test`, and follow the prompt(s).

!!! NOTE
    
    `so-elastalert-test` does not yet include all options available to `elastalert-test-rule`.

### Performance

For better performance, avoid writing rules that return large numbers of records. Instead, use the `use_count_query: true` in each rule file. This will only return counts of matching records and not the records themselves.

### Timeframe

For queries that span greater than a minute back in time, you may want to add the following fields to your rule to ensure searching occurs as planned (for example, for 10 minutes):


```
buffer_time:   
    minutes: 10
```   

```
allow_buffer_time_overlap: true
```

## Configuration

You can modify ElastAlert 2 configuration by going to [Administration](administration.md) --> Configuration --> ElastAlert.
